2. Extend the above program to support division of two numbers and ask user to choose if he wants to perform addition or division 
3. Write a program to implement sum of numbers in an array of numbers. 
4. Implement a program to output Mean, median and mode of a series of N numbers. Take N value from user and take N numbers as input. 
5. Implement a function that takes height and radius of N cylinders! The output should print the number of the cylinder with maximum volume. (For example if you provide 5 cylinder’s values and 3rd one has maximum volume, the output should be “3”).
6. Take a person Name as an input and output the frequency of all the letters in the name.
